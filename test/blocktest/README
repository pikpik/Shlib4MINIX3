Instructions on how to use blocktest:

1) compile it by running 'make'
2) read test.sh
3) edit and uncomment one line from test.sh
4) run './test.sh'
5) read the output in /var/log/messages

WARNING: while this tool works with both VFS and AVFS, it has been configured
to use AVFS's headers. Either use with AVFS, or edit blocktest.c first.
